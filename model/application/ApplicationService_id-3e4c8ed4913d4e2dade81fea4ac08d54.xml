    documentation="This tree exists for the purpose of facilitating the fulfillment of requests in Service objects.  It helps to decouple services from each other and from the JSON API interface.  &#xA;&#xA;This method's purpose is to facilitate turning the contents of the tree back into a JSON object.  It might need to be an abstract method that must be defined by the inheriting class.  Possibly, this functionality should be a separate thing.&#xA;&#xA;For example, once the Service Package Tree is completed, with all needed information stored in the Service objects, a complete Services object will be created - it containing the list of Service objects - to be later inserted into the outgoing JSON object.
