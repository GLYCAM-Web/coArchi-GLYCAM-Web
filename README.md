This repository is for collaborations on the enterprise architecture of GLYCAM-Web. 

- You need to use the [Archi software](https://www.archimatetool.com/). 
- The architecture diagrams use the [Archimate specification](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/archimate3-doc/)
- Please also see the [coArchi documentation](https://github.com/archimatetool/archi-modelrepository-plugin/wiki/Understand-the-Basics)

Note especially this quote:

> Important: you shouldnâ€™t use merge, pull requests or similar features from your Git server as this would most 
> certainly lead to model corruption. Though based on Git, the collaboration plugin adds several anti-corruption 
> actions while performing these operations.
